#Question 1:

Why only the required libraries are kept in the code?

We only add required libraries in the code as those are the ones that serve a purpose to 
complete each task efficiently, while other libraries do not. Pandas is used for manipulating 
data and for analysis to ensure no missing data. NumPy performs mathematical functions that are 
essential for statistical calculations, such as matrices for finding statistics. Matplotlib is 
used to create plots for data visualization, with the added support of Seaborn to enhance the 
aesthetics of plots and make them more informative. Scikit-learn (sklearn) is used to train machine 
learning models, test their performance, calculate ROC curves, transform categorical variables into 
numerical values for preprocessing data, and evaluate models. By using these required libraries, 
it ensures that the code is efficient, optimized, and effective for fulfilling each purpose. 
It also allows for better readability, and without unnecessary libraries, there is no confusion 
or misunderstanding in the code.
